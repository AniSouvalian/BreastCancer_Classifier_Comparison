# Breast Cancer Classifier Comparison

This is a machine learning project comparing different classification models on the Breast Cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

I trained and tested:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Dataset used: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset (from sklearn)

The goal: see which model does best at predicting if a tumor is malignant or benign based on several input features.

This project is for practice and learning.
